# ERC1400-SecurityTokenStandard

**Overview**

This project involves creating a decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates the handling of multiple security tokens using the ERC1400 token standard, along with ERC1594 and ERC1643 substandards. The platform is designed to support startup companies by allowing them to list their projects on the DEX. Retail investors can invest in these startups by purchasing security tokens, thus providing capital for innovative projects. The platform also enables the trading of these security tokens and offers Security Token Offerings (STO) for presales.

**Key Features**

ERC1400 Token Standard: Ensures compliance with security regulations for handling security tokens.

ERC1594 Substandard: Facilitates token transfers with additional verification processes.

ERC1643 Substandard: Allows for the storage and management of documentation related to the security tokens.

Startup Support: Enables startups to list their projects and gain funding from retail investors.

Security Token Trading: Provides a platform for trading security tokens.

Security Token Offerings (STO): Facilitates presales for listed projects.

**Technologies Used**

Solidity: Smart contract programming language.

Truffle Framework: Development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum.

Polygon and Sepolia Testnet: Deployment platforms for testing the DEX.

Web3.js and Ether.js: Libraries for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.

IPFS and Pinata API: For storing company documents in a decentralized manner.
